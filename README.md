# Immutable Seaport

Seaport is a marketplace protocol for safely and efficiently buying and selling NFTs.

Immutable Seaport is a fork of the Seaport protocol based on version 1.5, restricting basic order fulfillment flows and enforcing the use of an ImmutableSignableZone, which validates orders with an implementation of SIP7. This allows for full royalty enforcement from an off-chain order book.
